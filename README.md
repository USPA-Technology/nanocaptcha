NanoCaptcha
===========

NanoCaptcha is a Java library for generating CAPTCHAs. NanoCaptcha is
intended to be:

* Self-contained: no network API hits to any external services.

* Minimally-dependent: using NanoCaptcha should not involve pulling in
  a plethora of JARs.

NanoCaptcha is based on
[SimpleCaptcha](https://sourceforge.net/p/simplecaptcha/),
and uses
[JH Labs Java Image Filters](http://huxtable.com/ip/filters/).
